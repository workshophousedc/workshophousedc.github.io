We are always excited to meet more altruistic, ambitious people who want to be part of our community. So drag a friend to one of our upcoming events:
</p>


<h3>Upcoming</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Dec 12&mdash;Preserving Democracy discussion, a crossover event with iCivics and Effective Altruism DC: Civics education seems particularly important to both individual impact and safeguarding potential impact of other long-term programs. Is US democracy under threat and what can we do about it? Register: <a href="https://www.effectivealtruismdc.org/event/democracy-preservation-event-icivics">https://www.effectivealtruismdc.org/event/democracy-preservation-event-icivics</a>
</li>
<li>
Dec 21&mdash;Secular Solstice ceremony: Secular Solstice is a new humanist tradition. Every year on the darkest day we gather together to sing songs and tell stories about human history, civilization, death, suffering, and creating a better future. RSVP here: <a href="https://partiful.com/e/ynC91IJKRHAS11CM1eiE">https://partiful.com/e/ynC91IJKRHAS11CM1eiE</a>

<h3>Highlights from 2024</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Singalongs: <a href="https://www.dcsingalong.com/">DC Singalong</a> happens at Workshop every month or two&mdash;it’s a highly participatory event with lots of folk and pop songs and friendly faces, all welcome!
</li>
<li>
Parties: This year we hosted some very successful parties: Easter Puzzle Hunt, Casino Night, 4th of July & Halloween. 
</li>
<li>

Fall Firepits: During October we lit our firepit every Sunday evening and had friends gather and vegan marshmallows to toast as the weather cooled down.
</li>
<li>

Vegan BBQ: We organized a pilgrimage to Terry’s Healthy Foods in Rockville, and then had a lovely vegan barbeque at the house.
</li>
<li>

Political Organizing: various political groups gathered here to plan, train their team, and make signs.
</li>
<li>

Launches: startup organizations <a href="https://www.inpress.app/">InPress</a>, <a href="https://www.spiro.ngo/">Spiro</a>, and <a href="https://renaissancephilanthropy.org/">Renaissance Philanthropy</a> launched in the last year, all with connections to Workshop House!
</li>
<li>

Roof renovations: We redid our rooftop and HVAC systems at Workshop and are installing solar panels in the next few weeks. Special thanks to everyone who helped us clear the roof and carry stones!
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Get Involved</h3>

<p>
    We're community-builders at heart, and have two community
initiatives where we are particularly looking for people excited to
put in a bunch of work. 
</p>

<p>
    First is regular events. Workshop has a lot of one-off events, but
we currently don't have anyone running recurring events, and we think repeated
chill events have a ton of potential to nurture some neglected aspects of 
the community. So if you have ideas and/or energy to organize event series,
please let Lincoln know.
</p>

<p>
    Secondly, we're planning to co-organize a camp at <a href="https://www.fireflyartscollective.org/">Firefly</a>
in 2025, a mini Burning Man in the forest in Vermont. We need a few people who want to put
some serious effort into planning a camp. You don't have to be an experienced Burner, but you
do need to be willing to put a bunch of time in May and June. Let Lincoln know to what degree
you would like to be involved.
</p>

<p>Or, if you have other ideas, speak to Lincoln and we'll discuss!</p>
